## Inspiration

We often wanted to explore Notion APIs as well as since me and my teammates use Notion on a daily basis, maintaining todo table while switching windows was sometimes "ughhðŸ˜’" so we came up with this idea of making an extension just to stay on VSCode undistracted.

## What it does

As mentioned, it does the **CRUD** commands as well as it lets you to add **priority** and **status** making _your boring todo not so boring_.

## How we built it

- Falguni did a hell lot of JS heavily **Frontend and UI/UX logic** with which you gonna interact. ðŸ‘»
- Aniruddha did a hell lot of JS heavily (yes, again) **Backend** with which this extension gonna interact with. ðŸ¤¯
  - Used **Notion SDK** to built an **API** with **Express.js** to support all the **CRUD Operatoins** for Notion Pages where the **Integration** is added.
- Arkatapa did all this **documentation and poster stuffs**. ðŸ˜Ž

## Challenges we ran into

From getting our PC completely froze because of infinite loops of calling APIs to building a fully fledged backend and frontend is definitely not a easy task. We suffered from getting ECONNECTED ERROR to minute logic building. But all hail to **StackOverflow, YouTube and VSCode/NotionAPI docs**.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are now debbugging gangsta.

## What we learned

Learnt new stack and adapted it fully quickly.

## What's next for Awesome Todo Maintainer

We are going to definitely grow it more and will add more features.

**Enjoy!**
